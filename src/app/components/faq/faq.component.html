        <p>
          Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in
          decentralized data stores called Pods. Pods are like secure personal
          web servers for data. When data is stored in someone's Pod, they
          control which people and applications can access it.

          You need to find yourself a so called
          <strong>identity provider</strong> of which there are several. We
          recommend one of the following (you will be redirected away from
          SolidCryptPad).

            <h3>Why SolidCryptPad?</h3>

        <p>
          These days, many documents are written in web based editors such as
          Google Docs. When using these services, users usually do not have the
          choice of where their data is stored.
        </p>

        <p>
          SolidCryptPad offers improvements in terms of security and flexibility
          given that due to the Solid protocol you can freely choose and switch
          your storage provider.
        </p>

        <p>On top of that, everything you do is end-to-end encrypted.</p>
